The autocomplete portion of the block is quite clunky.  I was unable to get the built in Autocomplete react module to work, so I resorted to an alternative I found on Github. 

The block itself is not able to pull fresh data from the middleware on the front-end, this only works while in the Gutenberg editor.

Caching for the ski resort meta data is in place, but I didn't have enough time to implement caching for the autocomplete functionality. Also, the cache data should expire every 24 hours or so, but I didn't have enough time to get that part working. 

Thank you for your time, have a wonderful day! :)
